Whoa - where the hell did all the time go?!  I knew in the back of my mind that I was being a huge slacker by not updating in a while, but almost 5 years?  That's crazy!  My initial reaction was that the timestamp of my last post had gotten screwed up somehow, but the details of what I wrote proves that the time is right.

<!-- excerpt -->

I'll fill in more details in upcoming posts but some highlights of the last 5 years:

- Continued working on my software and hardware projects
- Starting playing around with 3D printing
- Took a fairly intensive master's degree program in software engineering
- Cataract surgery for my right eye (my left was April 2018 which I never wrote about)
- Made it through all the craziness of 2020 and beyond

I'm sure there are other things, but they're not coming to mind right now - I'll bring them up if I think of them later.
