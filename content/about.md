# About

I don't really know what to write here - I'd much rather write about other things, but I figure I need to introduce myself.

My name is Chris Kaczor, and I'm a software architect/engineer who likes to solve (and hopefully not cause) problems, determine how things should work, and figure out why the hell they aren't working.
